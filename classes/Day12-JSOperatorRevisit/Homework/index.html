        Assignment Operators
        1. " = ", to assign the values (x=y)
        2.  " += ", to assign the value with addition (x += y) = (x = x + y).
        3. " -= ", to assign the value with addition (x -= y) = (x = x - y).
        4. " *= ", to assign the value with addition (x *= y) = (x = x * y).

        Comparision Operators
        1. " == " to compare whether both values are equal or not? (x == y)
        2. " != " to compare whether both values are not equal or not? (x != y)
        3. " > " to compare whether one value is greater than other or not? (x > y)
        4. " < " to compare whether one value is smaller than other or not? (x < y)
        5. " >= " to compare whether one value is greater than or equal to other value or not? (x >= y)
        6. " <= " to compare whether one value is smaller than or equal to other value or not? (x <= y)
