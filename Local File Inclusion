<h1>  Local File Inclusion (LFI) </h1>




<p> An attacker can use Local File Inclusion (LFI) to trick the web application into exposing or running files on the web server.</p>
<p>An LFI attack may lead to information disclosure, remote code execution, or even Cross-site Scripting (XSS). Typically,</p>
<p>LFI occurs when an application uses the path to a file as input. If the application treats this input as trusted,</p>
<p>a local file may be used in the include statement.</p>

<p>Local File Inclusion is very similar to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). However, an attacker using LFI may only include local</p>
<p>files (not remote files like in the case of RFI).</p>

<h1>The following is an example of PHP code that is vulnerable to LFI.</h1>

<p>/**</p>
<p>* Get the filename from a GET</p>
<p>* Example - http://example.com/?file=filename.php</p>
<p>*/</p>
<p>$file = $_GET['file'];</p>

<p>/**</p>
<p>* Unsafely include the file</p>
<p>* Example - filename.php</p>
<p>*/</p>
<p>include('directory/' . $file);</p>
